CYBER PANIC LITE

How to Play

if no decks exist, create a deck.
	- Start with action creation Form
	- Once actions are created, the Card Form uses those actions
	- Once cards are created, the Deck Form uses cards

Action Types (What they should be)
	- Virus actions are simple attacks but can be blocked or reduced by firewalls
	- Firewall actions are shield granting actions
	- Patch actions are HP regenerating actions
	- Worm actions are piercing actions that do less damage than a virus but bypass shields

Card types
	- Card types were supposed to represent the main action of the card
	- This was intended to be used to categorize cards and assist the CPU with swap selections
	- As of now, it is just a flavor text for the Forms
	
Decks
	- Decks are the collection of five cards the player enters a match with.
	- Cards are not drawn or discarded. 
	- The deck is organized into the field cards and the hand cards
	- Field cards are the cards that are in play while hand cards are awaiting a swap.
	

Game Rules

Each player has 2 action points per turn
Actions that can be used are:
	- Card switch
	- Use a field card action
Once two actions have been made, then the round moves to the opponent's turn
	- No take backs
The game progresses in this simple fashion until the CPU or Player's software HP falls to 0
